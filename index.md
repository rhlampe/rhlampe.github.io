I'm a biological oceanographer that studies phytoplankton, primarily diatoms. My current research investigates how phytoplankton are influenced by or respond to changes in their environment such as ocean acidification, iron availability, nitrogen limitation, nutrient co-limitation, and the diel cycle. I am also studying the distribution and diversity of diatoms in the California Current Ecosystem. Current approaches and techniques that I primarily use include field-based manipulation experiments, large-scale oceanographic surveys, algal culturing with model and non-model organisms, quantitative (meta)transcriptomics, and amplicon sequencing.

I'm always interested in discussing my previous and current research as well as any potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out.
